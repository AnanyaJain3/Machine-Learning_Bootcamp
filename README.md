# Insights of this course

You may be wondering, *"Why should I study this course when there are numerous other courses and tutorials available online?"* It's a valid question, considering the overwhelming amount of information on the internet.

The internet is brimming with tens of thousands of resources for learning Machine Learning, but not all of them are of equal quality. Some fail to provide in-depth insights into concepts or explanations of why things work the way they do. Additionally, there are resources that contain inaccurate or misleading information.

We've encountered these challenges ourselves while learning Machine Learning, which is why we've developed this course with a unique and user-friendly approach. Instead of overwhelming you with exhaustive analyses and intricate details, we've carefully curated the best available resources for each topic. These references are chosen to offer you comprehensive insights and to address any doubts you may have, ensuring a crystal-clear understanding.

In essence, we've taken on the Herculean task of conducting thorough internet searches for you, so you don't have to. Our aim is to empower you on your journey to explore Data Science by providing concise explanations and guiding you to the most valuable resources. Happy Learning!

# Structure of the Course

## Week 1
 
 Our journey into the realm of Machine Learning commences with the establishment of a solid groundwork in different interconnected areas, such as Mathematics and coding abilities.

- We commence with **Python**, which is undeniably one of the most widely used programming languages worldwide, particularly in the context of Machine Learning and broader programming applications.

- Our next step involves delving into one of the fundamental skills in Machine Learning – **Data Plotting and Visualization**. This skill serves as an initial and crucial stage in addressing Machine Learning challenges. Understanding the data you're working with is imperative for developing effective Machine Learning models tailored to the task at hand.

- We also explore the concept of **Data Distribution**, which holds central importance in comprehending the types of models suitable for solving specific problems.

- Assuming we have a grasp of the data we're dealing with and understand its distribution, we encounter the need to **prepare** and **pre-process** the data to align it with the requirements of our chosen model. To address this, we introduce a highly useful library known as Pandas.

- Once the data is prepared, the next question is how to efficiently process it. This is where **Numpy – Numerical Python** comes into play. Numpy is extensively employed for numerical computation and is renowned for accelerating various computational tasks.

- We then aim to familiarize readers with the foundational concepts of Machine Learning, namely **Calculus and Linear Algebra**.

With this foundational knowledge in place, we are primed to delve deeply into the world of Machine Learning and explore every facet of it in detail, commencing in week 2.


## Week 2

We begin our walk with basics of Machine Learning i.e. Regression and Classification in this week.

- **Linear Regression** stands as one of the most fundamental concepts in Machine Learning, serving as a cornerstone upon which Machine Learning is built.

- Moving beyond simple Linear Regression, we explore a more efficient model commonly known as **Segmented Regression** and assess its performance relative to Simple Linear Regression.

- We delve into the intricacies of **Locally Weighted Regression**, a powerful Linear Regression model that thrives on high-quality observations, and we provide an in-depth exploration of this approach.

- Transitioning from the linear realm, we venture into **Logistic Regression**, a pivotal tool for data classification tasks.

- We introduce the relatively advanced **Naive Bayes Classifier**, extensively utilized in the era of Machine Learning.

- Building upon the Data Analysis skills acquired in Week 1, we delve into the realms of **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Data Pre-Processing**.

- Our journey culminates in the exploration of **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)**, a comprehensive approach that unifies various linear models. Although this topic involves mathematical concepts, we strive to present it in an intuitive manner, minimizing the focus on mathematical intricacies.
