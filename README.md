# Machine Learning Bootcamp

Hello everyone, Welcome to the Machine learning course offered by Google Developer Society.

In this course, we cover the essentials of Classical Machine Learning or the Pre-Deep Learning era. The readers are then introduced to Deep Learning - the backbone of Artifical Intelligence today. This course requires one to be familiar with basics of Python and some background in Calculus.
